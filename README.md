## Usage

To use this Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. If you'd like a suggestion, you can open Chrome DevTools. You will then see a panel open either below or to the side of the browser. This panel contains a list of topics we learned from Prework as well as a suggestion on which topic to study first.
